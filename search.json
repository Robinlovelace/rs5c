    "text": "Background\n\nSUVs are a status symbol (Dearman et al. 2023) and perceived as safer for occupants (Axsen and Long 2022).\nGlobal market share grew from 16% in 2010 to 48% in 2023 (International Energy Agency 2024).\nIn the UK, SUVs were 60% of new car sales in 2023 (Transport & Environment 2024).\nUS research shows SUVs increase risk to pedestrians (Henary et al. 2003; Ballesteros, Dischinger, and Langenberg 2004; Paulozzi 2005).\nThis work provides some analysis and poses further research questions in Great Britain."

    "text": "Discussion and Conclusions\n\nThe results confirm that SUVs are more dangerous for pedestrians in Great Britain, supporting findings from the USA.\nThis should motivate policy debates on vehicle size and road safety (Singh 2024).\nSupports measures like increased parking fees for large vehicles (European Commission 2024).\nFurther research is needed on specific vehicle characteristics like bumper height."
