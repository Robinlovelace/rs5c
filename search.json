    "text": "Background\n\nSUVs are a status symbol (Dearman et al. 2023) and perceived as safer for occupants (Axsen and Long 2022).\nGlobal market share grew from 16% in 2010 to 48% in 2023 (International Energy Agency 2024).\nIn the UK, SUVs were 60% of new car sales in 2023 (Transport & Environment 2024).\nUS research shows SUVs increase risk to pedestrians (Henary et al. 2003; Ballesteros, Dischinger, and Langenberg 2004; Paulozzi 2005).\nThis work provides some analysis and poses further research questions in Great Britain."

    "text": "Definitions of SUVs\n\nKIA (2019): “SUV stands for Sports Utility Vehicle, a car similar to a minivan or a station wagon, but with a much tougher look and a design suited for off-road driving.”\nLexus (2019): “SUV stands for Sports Utility Vehicle, a fairly loose term but one that generally refers to stylish, sleek looking vehicles that offer elegant city driving but also handle rugged terrain thanks to a typical 4x4 capability.”\nMitsubishi (2019): “SUV stands for sport utility vehicle, a term generally applied to automobiles that combine the features of a passenger car, like plenty of passenger and cargo space, with aspects of an off-road vehicle.”\nAutoTrader (2021): “SUV is automotive jargon that stands for Sports Utility Vehicle. It refers to a type of car that sits high up, off the ground, and often has four-wheel drive and sturdy styling.”"
