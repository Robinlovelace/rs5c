## Background

- SUVs are a status symbol [@dearman2023] and perceived as safer for occupants [@axsen2022].
- Global market share grew from 16% in 2010 to 48% in 2023 [@internationalenergyagency2024].
- In the UK, SUVs were 60% of new car sales in 2023 [@transportenvironment2024].
- US research shows SUVs increase risk to pedestrians [@henary2003; @ballesteros2004; @paulozzi2005].
- This study assesses the situation in Great Britain.

## Methods

- Data from STATS19 database on traffic casualties in Great Britain (2005-2022).
- 239 unique SUV models identified.
- Multinomial logit model used to explore the relationship between risk factors and injury severity.
- Outcomes: Fatal, Serious, or Slight injury.

# Results

```

## Model results

- Pedestrians hit by SUVs are more likely to be seriously injured (RRR = 1.126) or killed (RRR = 1.204) compared to those hit by non-SUVs.
- Vehicle mass is also a significant predictor of injury severity.
- SUV status is a better predictor than vehicle mass, width, or length alone.

## Discussion and Conclusions

- The results confirm that SUVs are more dangerous for pedestrians in Great Britain, supporting findings from the USA.
- This should motivate policy debates on vehicle size and road safety [@singh2024].
- Supports measures like increased parking fees for large vehicles [@europeancommission2024].
- Further research is needed on specific vehicle characteristics like bumper height.
