## Background

-   SUVs are a status symbol [@dearman2023] and perceived as safer for occupants [@axsen2022].
-   Global market share grew from 16% in 2010 to 48% in 2023 [@internationalenergyagency2024].
-   In the UK, SUVs were 60% of new car sales in 2023 [@transportenvironment2024].
-   US research shows SUVs increase risk to pedestrians [@henary2003; @ballesteros2004; @paulozzi2005].
-   This work provides some analysis and poses further research questions in Great Britain.

## Definitions of SUVs

-   [**KIA (2019)**](https://reurl.cc/E6Gg5m)**:** "SUV stands for Sports Utility Vehicle, a car similar to a minivan or a station wagon, but with a much tougher look and a design suited for off-road driving."
-   [**Lexus (2019)**](https://reurl.cc/qvknWy)**:** "SUV stands for Sports Utility Vehicle, a fairly loose term but one that generally refers to stylish, sleek looking vehicles that offer elegant city driving but also handle rugged terrain thanks to a typical 4x4 capability."
-   [**Mitsubishi (2019)**](https://reurl.cc/myIR19)**:** "SUV stands for sport utility vehicle, a term generally applied to automobiles that combine the features of a passenger car, like plenty of passenger and cargo space, with aspects of an off-road vehicle."
-   [**AutoTrader (2021)**](https://reurl.cc/vvkpNk)**:** "SUV is automotive jargon that stands for Sports Utility Vehicle. It refers to a type of car that sits high up, off the ground, and often has four-wheel drive and sturdy styling."

## SUV models

8 out of the top 10 best selling models were SUVs in 2024 ([SMMT](https://www.thecarexpert.co.uk/britains-best-selling-cars-of-2024/))

## SUV policies

-   Policies to discourage large vehicles are emerging due to safety and environmental concerns.
-   **Paris:** Voted to triple parking fees for vehicles over 1,600 kg (2,000 kg for electric), costing up to â‚¬18/hour in the city center [@europeancommission2024].
-   **UK:** Considering a "weight malus" or surcharge on the vehicle excise duty (VED) for heavier new cars, similar to a policy in France [@palmer2024; @rodger2024].

## Reforming UK car taxation

## Methods

-   Data from STATS19 database on traffic casualties in Great Britain (2005-2022).
-   239 unique SUV models identified.
-   Multinomial logit model used to explore the relationship between risk factors and injury severity.
-   Outcomes: Fatal, Serious, or Slight injury.

# Results

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| label: fig-counts
#| fig-cap: "Year-on-year pedestrian crash counts by vehicle type and severity (2005-2022)."
knitr::include_graphics("fig1.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Model and headline results

The probability of a particular crash $n$ resulting in a specific severity outcome $i$ is given by the following multinomial logit model:

$$
P_n(i) = \frac{\exp(\beta_i X_{in})}{\sum_{\forall I} \exp(\beta_I X_{In})}
$$

Relative Risk Ratios (RRR), relative to baseline outcome (slight), are calculated as $RRR = exp(X\beta_i)$.

-   Pedestrians hit by SUVs are more likely to be seriously injured (RRR = 1.126) or killed (RRR = 1.204) compared to those hit by non-SUVs.
-   Vehicle mass is also a significant predictor of injury severity.
-   SUV status is a better predictor than vehicle mass, width, or length alone.

## Limitations and Future Research

-   The binary SUV/non-SUV classification oversimplifies diversity of the vehicle fleet.
-   The STATS19 dataset lacks detailed vehicle design data, such as **bumper height** and front-end shape, which are likely key risk factors.
-   The study identifies increased risk but cannot fully explain the mechanisms (e.g., are SUV drivers more reckless, or is it purely vehicle design?).
-   Focus on severity says little about *frequency* of collisions nor *impacts on active travel*/stress/willingness to use active/public modes
-   Future work should investigate which specific vehicle characteristics are most dangerous, how vehicle characteristics and driver behaviour affect other modes, and explore the role of marketing and driver behavior

## Discussion and Conclusions

-   The results imply SUVs are more dangerous for pedestrians in Great Britain, supporting findings from the USA.
-   Motivate policy debates on vehicle size and road safety [@singh2024].
-   Supports measures like increased parking fees for large vehicles [@europeancommission2024].
-   Further research is needed on specific vehicle characteristics like bumper height.
